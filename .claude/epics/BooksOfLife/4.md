# Task: Book Management System

## Description
Implement a comprehensive book management system that allows users to search for books, add them to their library, track reading progress, and manage book metadata. This system will serve as the foundation for all book-related features in the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Book search functionality with multiple data sources (Google Books API, Open Library)
- [ ] Add books to personal library with metadata validation
- [ ] Reading progress tracking with page numbers and completion percentages
- [ ] Book metadata management (title, author, genre, publication date, etc.)
- [ ] Custom book lists creation and management
- [ ] Reading session history and analytics
- [ ] Book cover image handling and storage
- [ ] Import/export functionality for book data

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Build REST API endpoints and React components using existing patterns
- Key considerations:
  - Integrate with database schema from Task 2
  - Efficient search with debouncing and caching
  - Image optimization for book covers
  - Offline support for reading progress
  - Data validation and sanitization
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/src/app/api/books/` - New API routes
  - `/src/app/[locale]/(default)/library/` - New library pages
  - `/src/components/books/` - New book management components
  - `/src/services/books.ts` - Book service layer
  - `/src/models/book.ts` - Book data models

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 2 (Database Schema Extension) must be completed first
- [ ] External book API access (Google Books, Open Library)
- [ ] Image storage solution (existing or new)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 10
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] API endpoints implemented and tested
- [ ] React components built with responsive design
- [ ] Book search integrated with external APIs
- [ ] Reading progress tracking functional
- [ ] Data persistence working with new schema
- [ ] Image upload and optimization working
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
