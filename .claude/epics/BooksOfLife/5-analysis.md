# Issue #5 Analysis: AI Reading Assistant

## Work Streams

### Stream A: Frontend Chat Component
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Files:** 
- src/components/reading/AIAssistant.tsx
- src/components/ui/chat-message.tsx
- src/components/ui/chat-input.tsx
- src/components/ui/chat-history.tsx

**Description:** Build the React chat interface component with message display, input handling, typing indicators, and mobile-responsive design. Includes creating reusable chat UI components that can be used across the application.

**Can Start:** yes

### Stream B: Chat Hooks & State Management  
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Files:**
- src/hooks/useAIChat.ts
- src/hooks/useConversationHistory.ts
- src/types/chat.d.ts

**Description:** Implement custom React hooks for managing chat state, conversation history, message queuing, streaming response handling, and connection status. Includes TypeScript definitions for chat-related types.

**Can Start:** yes

### Stream C: AI Service Integration
**Agent:** general-purpose  
**Files:**
- src/services/aiService.ts
- src/app/api/chat/route.ts
- src/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts
- src/services/conversationService.ts

**Description:** Implement backend AI service integration leveraging the completed AI infrastructure from Task 3, create API endpoints for chat functionality with streaming support, and implement conversation persistence using the existing database schema.

**Can Start:** yes

## Coordination Notes
- Stream A can start independently as it focuses on UI components and presentation layer
- Stream B can develop in parallel with Stream A, providing the state management layer
- Stream C leverages the completed AI infrastructure from Task 3 for provider integration
- All streams will need final integration where:
  - Stream A components consume Stream B hooks
  - Stream B hooks call Stream C services
  - Stream C services utilize the AI infrastructure from completed Task 3
- Mobile responsiveness should be considered across all streams for consistent user experience

## Dependencies Status
- ✅ Task 3 (AI Infrastructure): COMPLETED - All streams (A-D) finished with full multi-provider AI support, failover, and testing
- ✅ Database schema: Existing user and session management available for conversation persistence
- ✅ Authentication: NextAuth.js integration available for user context
- ✅ WebSocket/SSE infrastructure: Can be implemented as part of Stream C using Next.js API routes

## Technical Considerations
- **Context Management**: Chat should have access to current reading content (book, chapter, page) for contextual responses
- **Streaming Responses**: Use Server-Sent Events or streaming API responses for real-time chat experience
- **Conversation Persistence**: Store chat history in database with user association
- **Mobile Optimization**: Chat interface should work seamlessly on mobile devices
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate limits for chat API usage

## Estimated Timeline
- Stream A: 4-5 hours (Chat UI components, responsive design)
- Stream B: 3-4 hours (Hooks and state management)
- Stream C: 5-6 hours (AI integration, API endpoints, persistence)
- Integration: 2 hours (Component integration, testing, polish)
- **Total: 14-17 hours** (matches original estimate)

## Integration Points
1. **A + B**: Chat components use hooks for state management
2. **B + C**: Hooks call backend services for AI responses
3. **C + Task 3**: AI service uses existing multi-provider infrastructure
4. **Reading Context**: Chat should integrate with reading view for contextual awareness
