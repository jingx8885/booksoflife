# Task: OCR Integration

## Description
Implement OCR (Optical Character Recognition) integration that allows users to capture text from physical books through camera or file upload. Enable passage-based queries using extracted text with the existing AI infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Camera interface for real-time text capture from book pages
- [ ] File upload functionality for image-based text extraction
- [ ] OCR service integration with high accuracy text recognition
- [ ] Extracted text can be used for AI-powered queries
- [ ] Error handling for poor quality images or unclear text

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Integrate third-party OCR service with camera/upload UI
- Key considerations: OCR accuracy, image processing, mobile compatibility
- Code locations/files affected: New OCR module, camera interface, AI query integration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3 - AI Infrastructure (needs AI services for processing extracted text)
- [ ] External dependencies: OCR service API, camera/file upload libraries

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
