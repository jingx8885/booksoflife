# Task: Database Schema Extension

## Description
Extend the existing Supabase schema with new tables to support book management functionality. This includes creating tables for books, reading sessions, reading notes, and book lists with proper relationships and constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Books table created with metadata fields (title, author, isbn, genre, etc.)
- [ ] Reading_sessions table created to track user reading progress
- [ ] Reading_notes table created for user annotations and highlights
- [ ] Book_lists table created for custom book collections
- [ ] Proper foreign key relationships established between tables
- [ ] Database indexes added for performance optimization
- [ ] Migration scripts created and tested

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Extend existing Drizzle schema in `/src/db/schema.ts`
- Key considerations: 
  - Maintain compatibility with existing user/auth tables
  - Design for scalability with proper indexing
  - Support for both individual books and series
  - Flexible metadata structure for different book types
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/src/db/schema.ts` - Main schema definitions
  - `/src/db/migrations/` - New migration files
  - `/src/models/` - TypeScript type definitions

## Dependencies
- [ ] No external dependencies - can start immediately
- [ ] Existing Supabase database connection
- [ ] Drizzle ORM setup

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with proper schema definitions
- [ ] Migration scripts created and tested locally
- [ ] TypeScript types generated and exported
- [ ] Schema documentation updated
- [ ] Database constraints and indexes verified
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
