# Task: AI Service Infrastructure

## Description
Build a multi-provider AI adapter system supporting Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, and Kimi with intelligent routing, failover, and load balancing capabilities. This infrastructure will provide reliable AI services for book recommendations, content analysis, and reading assistance features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-provider adapter interface created
- [ ] Individual provider implementations for Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, and Kimi
- [ ] Intelligent routing based on model capabilities and availability
- [ ] Automatic failover mechanism when providers are unavailable
- [ ] Load balancing across available providers
- [ ] Rate limiting and quota management per provider
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Configuration management for API keys and endpoints

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create abstracted service layer with provider-specific implementations
- Key considerations:
  - Standardized request/response format across all providers
  - Async/await patterns for concurrent requests
  - Circuit breaker pattern for failed providers
  - Caching layer for frequent requests
  - Model-specific optimizations (context windows, token limits)
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/src/services/ai/` - New AI service directory
  - `/src/types/ai.d.ts` - AI service type definitions
  - `/src/lib/config.ts` - Configuration management
  - Environment variables for API keys

## Dependencies
- [ ] No blocking dependencies - can start immediately  
- [ ] API credentials for each AI provider
- [ ] Network access to external AI service endpoints

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full multi-provider support
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing for all providers
- [ ] Integration tests for failover scenarios
- [ ] Documentation for adding new AI providers
- [ ] Configuration guide for API keys
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
