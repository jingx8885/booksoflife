- [ ] Bookmark functionality for specific pages/locations
- [ ] Reading history and analytics
- [ ] Multi-device sync for reading progress

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Build session management service with local storage and database persistence
- Key considerations: Performance optimization for large books, offline support, sync conflicts
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/src/services/sessionService.ts`
  - `/src/hooks/useReadingSession.ts`
  - `/src/components/reading/ChapterNavigation.tsx`
  - Database schema for reading sessions and progress

## Dependencies

- [ ] User authentication system

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
