# Stream B: Migration Scripts

## Scope
Create migration files for new tables and indexes

## Files
src/db/migrations/

## Completed Work
✅ Created migration file `0004_books_and_reading_tables.sql` with:
- books table with comprehensive metadata fields (title, author, isbn, genre, etc.)
- reading_sessions table for tracking user reading progress
- reading_notes table for user annotations and highlights  
- book_lists table for custom book collections
- book_list_items table as junction table for list-book relationships
- All necessary indexes for performance optimization:
  - books: title, author, isbn, genre, series, language, format, status, created_at
  - reading_sessions: user, book, date, user+book composite
  - reading_notes: user, book, type, page, created_at, user+book composite
  - book_lists: user, type, public status, created_at, user+type+default unique
  - book_list_items: list, book, user, status, added_at, user+status composite, list+book unique

✅ Updated migration journal (`_journal.json`) with new migration entry
✅ Migration scripts are compatible with existing schema
✅ Committed changes with proper formatting

## Technical Details
- Migration follows Drizzle ORM conventions
- All tables include proper identity columns and constraints
- Indexes optimized for common query patterns
- Unicode support for international book metadata
- Flexible JSON metadata field for extensibility

## Dependencies Satisfied
- Stream A completed schema definitions ✅
- Ready for Stream C to implement TypeScript types
