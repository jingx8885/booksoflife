# Stream C: Service Orchestration

## Scope
Intelligent routing, failover, load balancing, and circuit breakers

## Files
- `src/services/ai/orchestrator.ts` ✅
- `src/services/ai/router.ts` ✅

## Progress
✅ **COMPLETED** - Service Orchestration Implementation

### Implemented Features

#### Router (`src/services/ai/router.ts`)
- **Intelligent Provider Selection**: Advanced scoring algorithm considering availability, capabilities, performance, reliability, and cost
- **Capability-Based Filtering**: Automatic provider filtering based on request requirements (streaming, function calling, images, documents, context window)
- **Load Balancing Strategies**: Support for round-robin, priority-based, random, and latency-based selection
- **Use Case Optimization**: Specialized routing recommendations for book analysis, recommendations, summarization, chat, and translation
- **Fallback Chains**: Intelligent fallback provider ordering for resilient failover
- **Model-Specific Routing**: Direct routing to providers that support specific models

#### Orchestrator (`src/services/ai/orchestrator.ts`)
- **Service Orchestration**: High-level coordination of all AI operations with comprehensive error handling
- **Automatic Failover**: Intelligent failover with configurable maximum attempts and exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Full circuit breaker pattern implementation for provider reliability
- **Request Queuing**: Advanced request queuing system for handling high load scenarios
- **Streaming Support**: Complete streaming request orchestration with failover capabilities
- **Statistics & Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics collection and performance monitoring
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper resource cleanup and request completion handling

#### Enhanced Main Service (`src/services/ai/index.ts`)
- **Simplified Interface**: Clean abstraction layer over orchestrator complexity
- **Routing Criteria Support**: Full integration with intelligent routing system
- **Detailed Results**: Optional detailed orchestration results for debugging and monitoring
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing API while adding new capabilities

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Intelligent Routing Logic** ✅
   - Multi-factor scoring system (availability, reliability, cost, capabilities)
   - Request complexity analysis and optimal provider selection
   - Dynamic provider health monitoring and exclusion

2. **Automatic Failover Mechanism** ✅
   - Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Provider exclusion from failover chains after failures
   - Different retry strategies for streaming vs regular requests

3. **Load Balancing** ✅
   - Multiple strategies: round-robin, priority, random, least-latency
   - Health-aware load balancing with circuit breaker integration
   - Provider priority and weight configuration support

4. **Circuit Breaker Pattern** ✅
   - Per-provider circuit breakers with configurable thresholds
   - State management (closed, open, half-open) with automatic recovery
   - Failure count tracking and timeout-based recovery

5. **Advanced Features** ✅
   - Request queuing with configurable size and timeout limits
   - Response caching with TTL and size-based eviction
   - Comprehensive statistics and monitoring
   - Use case-specific routing recommendations
   - Provider capability matching and validation

### Architecture Highlights

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between routing logic and orchestration
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new providers, routing strategies, and capabilities
- **Resilience**: Multiple layers of error handling and recovery mechanisms  
- **Performance**: Efficient caching, queuing, and background health monitoring
- **Observability**: Detailed metrics, logging, and status reporting

### Testing & Integration

The implementation builds upon the completed Stream A (Core AI Adapter Interface) and Stream B (AI Provider Implementations) infrastructure, providing a complete, production-ready AI service orchestration system for the BooksOfLife application.

**Commit**: `b6d4ce0` - Complete Stream C service orchestration implementation
