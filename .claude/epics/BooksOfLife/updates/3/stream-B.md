  - Handles API-specific request/response format conversion
- ✅ Implemented DeepSeekAdapter with OpenAI-compatible API
  - Supports streaming chat completions
  - Includes DeepSeek Chat and Coder models
  - Cost-efficient provider with good code capabilities
- ✅ Implemented QwenAdapter with Alibaba DashScope API
  - Supports streaming with SSE format
  - Includes Qwen Max, Plus, and Turbo models
  - Handles DashScope-specific API format
- ✅ Implemented KimiAdapter with Moonshot AI API
  - OpenAI-compatible with large context windows
  - Includes 8K, 32K, and 128K context models
  - Excellent for document processing use cases
- ✅ Created provider index with factory functions
  - Centralized adapter creation and management
  - Utility functions for capability-based provider selection
  - Health checking and adapter summary functions
- ✅ Updated main AI service to use new provider adapters

## Implementation Details

### Adapter Features
- All adapters extend BaseAIAdapter for consistent behavior
- Comprehensive error handling with provider-specific error types
- Streaming support with proper chunk formatting
- Health check endpoints for reliability monitoring
- Rate limit status reporting where available
- Model capability definitions with costs and limits

### Provider Capabilities
- **Gemini**: Best for images and documents, 2M context window
- **DeepSeek**: Most cost-effective, excellent for code generation
- **Qwen**: Good balance of features with image support
- **Kimi**: Largest context windows up to 128K, great for documents

### Error Handling
- Authentication errors for invalid API keys
- Rate limiting with proper backoff timing
- Network error detection and recovery
- Model availability validation
- Circuit breaker integration for reliability

## Files Created
- `src/services/ai/providers/gemini.ts` - Google Generative AI adapter
- `src/services/ai/providers/deepseek.ts` - DeepSeek API adapter  
- `src/services/ai/providers/qwen.ts` - Alibaba DashScope adapter
- `src/services/ai/providers/kimi.ts` - Moonshot AI adapter
- `src/services/ai/providers/index.ts` - Provider factory and utilities

## Coordination Notes
- No dependencies on other streams
- All required interfaces from Stream A are properly implemented
- Ready for integration with routing and failover systems
