# Stream A Progress: Core AI Adapter Interface

## Status: In Progress

## Tasks Completed:
- [x] Read full task requirements from issue #3
- [x] Analyzed existing codebase structure
- [x] Identified that src/services/ai/ needs to be created
- [x] Confirmed src/types/ai.d.ts needs to be created

## Current Work:
- [ ] Creating base AI adapter interface in src/services/ai/base.ts
- [ ] Defining TypeScript types in src/types/ai.d.ts
- [ ] Establishing error handling patterns
- [ ] Setting up async/await patterns for concurrent requests

## Files to Modify:
- src/services/ai/base.ts (create)
- src/types/ai.d.ts (create)

## Coordination Notes:
- No conflicts detected with other streams yet
- Working independently on base interface and types
- Will need to coordinate with other streams once base interface is established

## Next Steps:
1. Create AI types definitions
2. Implement base adapter interface
3. Set up error handling patterns
4. Create foundation for circuit breaker and caching patterns
