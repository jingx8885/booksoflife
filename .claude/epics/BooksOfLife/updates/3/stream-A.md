# Stream A Progress: Core AI Adapter Interface

## Status: In Progress

## Tasks Completed:
- [x] Read full task requirements from issue #3
- [x] Analyzed existing codebase structure
- [x] Identified that src/services/ai/ needs to be created
- [x] Confirmed src/types/ai.d.ts needs to be created

## Current Work:
- [x] Creating base AI adapter interface in src/services/ai/base.ts
- [x] Defining TypeScript types in src/types/ai.d.ts
- [x] Establishing error handling patterns
- [x] Setting up async/await patterns for concurrent requests
- [x] Create main AI service orchestrator
- [x] Add configuration management

## Files Created:
- src/services/ai/base.ts âœ…
- src/types/ai.d.ts âœ…
- src/services/ai/index.ts âœ…
- src/services/ai/config.ts âœ…

## Coordination Notes:
- No conflicts detected with other streams yet
- Working independently on base interface and types
- Will need to coordinate with other streams once base interface is established

## Completed Deliverables:
âœ… Create base AI adapter interface with standardized request/response format
âœ… Define TypeScript types for AI providers, models, and responses  
âœ… Establish error handling patterns and logging interfaces
âœ… Design async/await patterns for concurrent requests
âœ… Set up foundation for circuit breaker and caching patterns
âœ… Create main AI service orchestrator with load balancing
âœ… Add comprehensive configuration management

## Status: 
ðŸŽ¯ **STREAM COMPLETED** - All core AI adapter infrastructure is in place

## Integration Notes for Other Streams:
- Other streams can now implement provider-specific adapters by extending BaseAIAdapter
- Main entry point: src/services/ai/index.ts exports AIService class
- Configuration: src/services/ai/config.ts handles environment-based setup
- All types available from src/types/ai.d.ts
