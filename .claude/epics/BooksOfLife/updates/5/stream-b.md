# Stream B: Chat Hooks & State Management

## Scope
Implement custom React hooks for managing chat state, conversation history, message queuing, streaming response handling, and connection status. Includes TypeScript definitions for chat-related types.

## Files
- src/hooks/useAIChat.ts
- src/hooks/useConversationHistory.ts
- src/types/chat.d.ts

## Progress
### âœ… Completed
- **Chat Types (src/types/chat.d.ts)**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for chat functionality including:
  - ChatMessage, Conversation, ChatState interfaces
  - Streaming state management types
  - Hook options and return types
  - Error handling and storage interfaces
  - Book context and user preference types
  - Metrics and storage abstractions

- **useAIChat Hook (src/hooks/useAIChat.ts)**: Full-featured AI chat state management hook with:
  - Real-time streaming response handling
  - Message queuing and retry logic
  - Book context integration for reading-aware responses
  - Connection status tracking and error handling
  - Auto-save functionality
  - Comprehensive utility functions
  - Metrics tracking for performance monitoring
  - Cancellation and cleanup support

- **useConversationHistory Hook (src/hooks/useConversationHistory.ts)**: Complete conversation persistence system with:
  - Browser localStorage-based storage implementation
  - Full CRUD operations for conversations
  - Auto-loading and filtering by book/user
  - Import/export functionality
  - Search and recent conversation utilities
  - Storage usage monitoring
  - Automatic conversation title generation
  - Integration points for chat hook updates

### Key Implementation Features
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time message updates with Server-Sent Events
- **Context Awareness**: Book-specific context in all interactions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and user feedback
- **Performance**: Debounced saves, efficient state management
- **Storage**: Persistent conversation history with size management
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
- **Integration**: Hooks designed to work together seamlessly

### Architecture Decisions
- Separation of chat state vs conversation history concerns
- Browser storage with async interface for easy backend migration
- Message queuing system for reliable delivery
- Context-aware AI request building
- Comprehensive error typing and handling
- Utility functions for common operations
