# Stream C: AI Service Integration

## Scope
Implement backend AI service integration leveraging the completed AI infrastructure from Task 3, create API endpoints for chat functionality with streaming support, and implement conversation persistence using the existing database schema.

## Files
- src/services/aiService.ts
- src/app/api/chat/route.ts
- src/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts
- src/services/conversationService.ts

## Progress
### ✅ Completed

- **AI Service (src/services/aiService.ts)**: Complete reading assistant AI service with:
  - Integration with Task 3 AI infrastructure (BaseAIService, providers, routing)
  - Book context-aware system prompt generation
  - Support for both streaming and non-streaming responses
  - User preference handling (response style, language, examples)
  - Conversation title generation for new conversations
  - Health status monitoring and statistics

- **Chat API (src/app/api/chat/route.ts)**: Full-featured non-streaming chat endpoint with:
  - Authentication and user session management
  - Conversation creation and retrieval logic
  - Message persistence to database
  - Book context integration for reading-aware responses
  - Error handling for AI service failures (rate limits, auth, quotas)
  - CRUD operations for conversations (GET, DELETE support)
  - Integration with conversation service for persistence

- **Streaming Chat API (src/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts)**: Real-time streaming endpoint with:
  - Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation
  - Chunk-by-chunk streaming response handling
  - Real-time message accumulation and database persistence
  - Conversation metadata streaming (for new conversations)
  - Error handling and graceful stream termination
  - CORS support for cross-origin requests

- **Conversation Service (src/services/conversationService.ts)**: Complete persistence layer with:
  - Full CRUD operations for conversations and messages
  - Database schema integration (ai_conversations, ai_messages tables)
  - Book and session context support
  - Message sequencing and conversation statistics
  - Archive/delete functionality with soft and hard delete options
  - AI message format conversion utilities
  - User conversation statistics and analytics

### Integration Points Verified
- ✅ Uses existing AI infrastructure from Task 3 (BaseAIService, providers, routing)
- ✅ Integrates with authentication system (getUserUuid, session management)  
- ✅ Uses existing database schema (ai_conversations, ai_messages tables)
- ✅ Compatible with Stream B hooks (API endpoint format matches hook expectations)
- ✅ Book context integration with existing book management system
