# PRD: BooksOfLife

## Executive Summary

BooksOfLife is an AI-powered reading acceleration platform that addresses the modern challenge of book ownership without completion. The platform combines AI-assisted reading experiences with community-driven book recommendations to create a positive feedback loop: AI helps users read faster and deeper, while users share their best book insights with the community.

**Target Market**: 15-35 year olds who buy books but struggle to finish them
**Core Value Proposition**: Transform book collections from decorative to transformative through AI-powered reading assistance
**Business Model**: Subscription-based with multiple revenue streams including paid note sharing and book affiliate sales

## Problem Statement

### Primary Problem
Modern readers face the "buying vs. reading gap" - they purchase books with good intentions but fail to complete them due to:
- Books often use complex, non-conversational language
- Knowledge gap between authors and readers creates comprehension barriers
- Lack of immediate context and concept overview before reading
- No real-time support for understanding difficult passages
- Poor reading environment affecting focus and absorption

### Market Opportunity
Current solutions focus on book tracking or social features, but none address the fundamental reading comprehension and acceleration challenge. This represents a blank market opportunity for AI-assisted reading.

### Why Now
- Large Language Models have extensive book knowledge pre-trained
- AI can provide real-time reading assistance and personalized explanations
- Growing awareness of the reading crisis among young adults
- Technology acceptance for AI-powered learning tools is at an all-time high

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metrics: "Book Activity" (More Important than DAU)
- **Daily Book Activity**: Number of books actively being read/interacted with daily
- **Book Completion Rate**: Percentage of started books that are finished
- **Reading Velocity**: Average days to complete a book (track improvement over time)
- **AI Interaction Density**: Number of AI queries per reading session

### Secondary Metrics: User Engagement
- **Monthly Active Users**: Users who read at least one session per month
- **Reading Streak**: Consecutive days/weeks of reading activity
- **Note Generation**: Number of AI-generated notes created and saved

### Business Metrics
- **Token Usage**: AI API consumption (direct revenue correlation)
- **Subscription Conversion**: Free to paid user conversion rate
- **User Lifecycle Value**: Revenue per user over time
- **Note Monetization**: Revenue from paid book list sharing

### Quality Indicators
- **User Reading Progress**: Average completion percentage improvement
- **Reading Comprehension**: Measured through AI interaction quality
- **Platform Stickiness**: Monthly retention rate
- **Community Value**: Popular book lists and note sharing activity

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- AI API rate limits and costs scale with usage
- OCR accuracy dependent on image quality
- Internet connectivity required for AI features
- Large language model context windows limit conversation length

### Business Constraints
- One-person development team limits parallel feature development
- Bootstrap funding requires careful cost management
